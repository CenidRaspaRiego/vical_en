# Configuration

Before calculating the VIs in VICAL, a series of parameters that correspond to the configuration must be selected. 

## General configuration 
When starting, to estimate the VI of any surface the user has two options: _i) digitize polygons or ii) Use a GEE vector file_. In addition, you need to configure other options, these are:

**1). Date range: ** It is necessary to enter a start and end date, which corresponds to the interval in which you want to estimate the VIs (Figure \@ref(fig:figG1)). The date must have the following format: AAAA-MM-DD, _Four digits for the year, two for the month and two for the day_.
```{r figG1, fig.cap='Date Range TextBox', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure1.png")
```


VICAL uses this interval to search for available Landsat or sentinel-2 images, and with these images estimate VIs. VICAL by default sets the end date as the current date and the start date one year ago to the current date.

**2) Cloud Percentage: ** A maximum cloud threshold must be entered, by default it is set to 30% (Figure \@ref(fig:figG2)).
```{r figG2, fig.cap='Cloud Percentage Threshold', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure2.png")
```


**3). Satellite: ** four available options are derived from landsat and sentinel-2 satellites (described in the section \@ref(Sat) **Satellites**) (Figure \@ref(fig:figG3)):

```{r figG3, fig.cap='Satellites and sensors available at VICAL', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure3.png")
```


|  _**i) Landsat (7, 8 y 9):** returns Landsat images from sensors 7, 8 and 9 that are within the user-defined interval and with a maximum cloud threshold. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were spectrally fitted to Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands (OLI and OLI-2) using the procedure recommended by [@Roy2016] to generate a single set of harmonized data._ 

|  _**ii)	Sentinel-2:** returns Sentinel-2 images that are within the user-defined interval and with the maximum cloud threshold._

|  _**iii)	Landsat (7, 8 y 9) and Sentinel-2**: Returns both Landsat (7, 8 and 9) and Sentinel-2 images. Sentinel-2 MSI data are spectrally fit to Landsat-8 and 9 (OLI and OLI-2) spectral bands using the procedure recommended by [@Claverie2018]. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were spectrally fitted to Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands (OLI and OLI-2) using the procedure recommended by [@Roy2016]. In this way a single set of harmonized data is generated._ 

|  _**iv)	Landsat (4 y 5):** returns LandSat -4 and 5 images that are within the defined interval and with a maximum cloud threshold._
  


**4). Vegetation index: ** The user can select from 23 VIs commonly used in agricultural applications (Figure \@ref(fig:figG4)), The formulas for each vegetation index are found in the section \@ref(Iveg) **Vegetation Indices**.
```{r figG4, fig.cap='Vegetation Index Selector', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure5.png")
```

```{r figG5, fig.cap='Coeficientes de IV', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure5.1.png")
```


**5) other additional functions: ** VICAL allows you to select additional options (Figure \@ref(fig:figG6)), for example:


```{r figG6, fig.cap='Optional configuration in VICAL', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure9.png")
```


| _**i)	Use a GEE vector file:** As indicated in the initial part of this chapter, the user can use a GEE vector file (polygon type). For this option, you must enter a URL address (Table ID) of the vector file that has been uploaded to GEE (Figure \@ref(fig:figG7)). in this way, even if there are digitized polygons, VICAL recognizes that the VIs must be calculated on the polygons of the vector file. _

```{r figG7, fig.cap='Table ID of the GEE vector file', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure10.png")
```

| _**ii) regression map:** The user obtains as a result a regression map based on the values of the calculated VIs. You can select between four types of functions: linear, quadratic, potential and exponential, and then you need to enter the adjustment coefficients for the selected function (Figure \@ref(fig:figG8))._ 

```{r figG8, fig.cap='Functions considered', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure8.png")
```


| _**iii)	Filter images that cover the entire polygon:** Images that completely cover the polygon(s) are filtered, otherwise images are displayed even if they cover a certain percentage of the polygon. This option is useful for polygons that cover large surfaces (hundreds of hectares)._
 
| _**iv)	Calculate weighting factor (WF):** WF is the ratio of the VI value in a pixel to the average VI in the polygon (parcel). It is calculated for each digitized polygon. The WF in an agricultural parcel is a standardized indicator of the productive potential of each pixel of an image. _


**5) Calculate: **: When the options have been configured, click on **calculate** and at least three layers will be shown on the map: _**i) RGB image of the first image found in the set interval, ii) VI map, iii) digitized polygons**. _


## Using digitized polygons
The user can digitize any parcel (polygons) using the drawing tools found in the upper left corner of the map (Figure \@ref(fig:figG9)). VICAL recognizes that VIs must be calculated on these polygons.

```{r figG9, fig.cap='Drawing tools', echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure11.png")
```

This option is useful when there are few parcels where you want to estimate VIs (Figure \@ref(fig:figG10)). O bien, It is also useful when you want to download VIs for a particular area regardless of parcel boundaries. (Figure \@ref(fig:figG11)). 

To edit the polygon or create a new polygon, click on the _“Edit and New Polygon”_ buttons, respectively. These options are available after a calculation has been performed.
```{r figG10, fig.cap='Digitized parcels', echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure12.png")
```

```{r figG11, fig.cap='poligono digitalizados', echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure13.png")
```


## Using GEE vector file

For this option, the user must enter the **URL (Table ID)** of the vector file with which the calculations are to be performed; this indicates that you must have a GEE account and import a polygon-type vector file into your account.

The *Table ID** can be obtained by left clicking on the file found in the **Assets** tab of your GEE account (Figure \@ref(fig:figG12)).

```{r figG12, fig.cap='vector file details', echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure14.png")
```


So that the vector file can be used in **VICAL**, you must have the “Anyone can read” box activated (Figure \@ref(fig:figG13)). 

```{r figG13, fig.cap='Share option view', echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Figure6.png")
```
