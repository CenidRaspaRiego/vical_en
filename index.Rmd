# Welcome {-}

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/LogoVICAL.png")
```

This site is a guide to use the **VICAL** tool developed within Google Earth Engine (GEE). VICAL calculates **online** 23 vegetation indices (commonly used in agricultural applications) of any polygon(s) in the world (digitized by the user or vector file) using LandSat and Sentinel-2 images. This is done without the user downloading/uploading satellite images of writing a single line of code, they just need to have an internet connection. 


A web application is also available <https://inifapcenidraspa.users.earthengine.app/view/vical>.


```{r fig2, fig.cap='Vista principal de VICAL', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Captura2.png")
```

This work was developed by researchers from **INIFAP CENID-RASPA** and **CEVAF**. Among the improvements planned for VICAL is that are intended for VICAL is that through experimentation the calibration of biophysical variables of interest for various crops is achieved using _vegetation indices (IV)_; and these results are available in **VICAL** to be useful to other people and thus they can easily monitor variables related to irrigation engineering. 


_Please check back occasionally for new GEE applications, example scripts, and VICAL updates. You might try doing a hard refresh on the site to make sure you see recent changes (what you’re looking at might be a previously cached version of the site)_

_If you have any questions or suggestions or wish to participate in the project, you can write to the email **jimenez.sergio@inifap.gob.mx**_
