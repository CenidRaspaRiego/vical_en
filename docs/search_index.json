VICAL calculates online 23 vegetation indices (commonly used in agricultural applications) of any polygon(s) in the world (digitized by the user or vector file) using LandSat and Sentinel-2 images. This is done without the user downloading/uploading satellite images of writing a single line of code, they just need to have an internet connection. A web application is also available https://inifapcenidraspa.users.earthengine.app/view/vical. Figure 0.1: Vista principal de VICAL This work was developed by researchers from INIFAP CENID-RASPA and CEVAF. Among the improvements planned for VICAL is that are intended for VICAL is that through experimentation the calibration of biophysical variables of interest for various crops is achieved using vegetation indices (IV); and these results are available in VICAL to be useful to other people and thus they can easily monitor variables related to irrigation engineering. Please check back occasionally for new GEE applications, example scripts, and VICAL updates.

It describes the VICAL conceptual framework, the vegetation indices (VIs) considered and the images collections used to calculate it, how to run it, what the outputs are, and how they are formatted. VICAL was developed within the GEE platform https://earthengine.google.com/ and was coded in JavaScript from the Earth Engine Code Editor https://code.earthengine.google.com/. 1.1 Scopes The design principles for VICAL were that it should provide for any area (defined by the user) where there is a Landsat or Sentinel-2 image, the estimation of different VIs applied in agriculture. In addition, to graph the VI time series for that area in the date range established by the user. All without the user writing a single line of code within the GEE platform or performing image pre-processing. The VICAL tool has three main functions:: 1.- calculation of 23 VIs with images (cloud-free) from Landsat (4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) and Sentinel-2 data from any user-defined area. 2.- VI time series plot for each polygon drawn by the user with Landsat and Sentinel-2 or both satellites. 3.- Regression maps (linear, quadratic, potential or exponential function) or weighting factor using VIs values. In this tool, you can configure some VI coefficients such as EVI, SAVI, among others. We believe that the VICAL tool saves time and avoids the trivial repetitive procedure associated with “manual” VI calculations (image download, processing, etc.), which requires different types of software, which can lead to human error. VICAL can be used to quickly extract VIs values for calibration in agricultural biophysical variables. "],["Sat.html", "Chapter 2 Satellites - Image Collection", " Chapter 2 Satellites - Image Collection VICAL used the atmospherically corrected land surface reflectance images from Landsat (missions 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9, with images from 1982 to present) and Sentinel-2.

In addition, you need to configure other options, these are: 1). Date range: It is necessary to enter a start and end date, which corresponds to the interval in which you want to estimate the VIs (Figure 4.1). The date must have the following format: AAAA-MM-DD, Four digits for the year, two for the month and two for the day. Figure 4.1: Date Range TextBox VICAL uses this interval to search for available Landsat or sentinel-2 images, and with these images estimate VIs. VICAL by default sets the end date as the current date and the start date one year ago to the current date. 2) Cloud Percentage: A maximum cloud threshold must be entered, by default it is set to 30% (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Cloud Percentage Threshold 3). Satellite: four available options are derived from landsat and sentinel-2 satellites (described in the section 2 Satellites) (Figure 4.3): Figure 4.3: Satellites and sensors available at VICAL  i) Landsat (7, 8 y 9): returns Landsat images from sensors 7, 8 and 9 that are within the user-defined interval and with a maximum cloud threshold. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were spectrally fitted to Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands (OLI and OLI-2) using the procedure recommended by (Roy 2016) to generate a single set of harmonized data.  ii) Sentinel-2: returns Sentinel-2 images that are within the user-defined interval and with the maximum cloud threshold.  iii) Landsat (7, 8 y 9) and Sentinel-2: Returns both Landsat (7, 8 and 9) and Sentinel-2 images. Sentinel-2 MSI data are spectrally fit to Landsat-8 and 9 (OLI and OLI-2) spectral bands using the procedure recommended by (Claverie 2018). Landsat 7 ETM+ data were spectrally fitted to Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands (OLI and OLI-2) using the procedure recommended by (Roy 2016). In this way a single set of harmonized data is generated.  iv) Landsat (4 y 5): returns LandSat -4 and 5 images that are within the defined interval and with a maximum cloud threshold. 4). Vegetation index: The user can select from 23 VIs commonly used in agricultural applications (Figure 4.4), The formulas for each vegetation index are found in the section 3 Vegetation Indices. Figure 4.4: Vegetation Index Selector Figure 4.5: Coeficientes de IV 5) other additional functions: VICAL allows you to select additional options (Figure 4.6), for example: Figure 4.6: Optional configuration in VICAL i) Use a GEE vector file: As indicated in the initial part of this chapter, the user can use a GEE vector file (polygon type). For this option, you must enter a URL address (Table ID) of the vector file that has been uploaded to GEE (Figure 4.7). in this way, even if there are digitized polygons, VICAL recognizes that the VIs must be calculated on the polygons of the vector file. Figure 4.7: Table ID of the GEE vector file ii) regression map: The user obtains as a result a regression map based on the values of the calculated VIs. You can select between four types of functions: linear, quadratic, potential and exponential, and then you need to enter the adjustment coefficients for the selected function (Figure 4.8). Figure 4.8: Functions considered iii) Filter images that cover the entire polygon: Images that completely cover the polygon(s) are filtered, otherwise images are displayed even if they cover a certain percentage of the polygon. This option is useful for polygons that cover large surfaces (hundreds of hectares). iv) Calculate weighting factor (WF): WF is the ratio of the VI value in a pixel to the average VI in the polygon (parcel). It is calculated for each digitized polygon. The WF in an agricultural parcel is a standardized indicator of the productive potential of each pixel of an image. 5) Calculate: : When the options have been configured, click on calculate and at least three layers will be shown on the map: i) RGB image of the first image found in the set interval, ii) VI map, iii) digitized polygons. 4.2 Using digitized polygons The user can digitize any parcel (polygons) using the drawing tools found in the upper left corner of the map (Figure 4.9). VICAL recognizes that VIs must be calculated on these polygons. Figure 4.9: Drawing tools This option is useful when there are few parcels where you want to estimate VIs (Figure 4.10). O bien, It is also useful when you want to download VIs for a particular area regardless of parcel boundaries. (Figure 4.11). To edit the polygon or create a new polygon, click on the “Edit and New Polygon” buttons, respectively. These options are available after a calculation has been performed. Figure 4.10: Digitized parcels Figure 4.11: poligono digitalizados 4.3 Using GEE vector file For this option, the user must enter the URL (Table ID) of the vector file with which the calculations are to be performed; this indicates that you must have a GEE account and import a polygon-type vector file into your account. The *Table ID can be obtained by left clicking on the file found in the Assets** tab of your GEE account (Figure 4.12). Figure 4.12: vector file details So that the vector file can be used in VICAL, you must have the “Anyone can read” box activated (Figure 4.13).

These maps, at first, are obtained from the first image found in the image collection.. The following images show some visualizations obtained from the URL that comes by default in VICAL ( “Use vector file from GEE” was activated) and activating the linear regression option with coefficients of a=1.15 and b=0.17.

To do this, a bar appears on the upper right side, where clicking on it displays a list where each row represents an image. The short nomenclature used to name the images is: (Figure 5.5): Image number found+ point + Image date (starting with year, month and day)+ / + Sensor + / + Cloud percentage in the image. Figure 5.5: List of images found Click on any row you want to view and the layers described in section 5.1 will appear (Figure 5.6). Figure 5.6: Maps for the selected date 5.3 VI map display The user can change the display values of the VI map by changing the range in which the maximum and minimum value varies, for this, it is necessary to enter the values in the option “VI map display” (Figure 5.7) and press the Enter key with the keyboard. Figure 5.7: IV map display setting The program recognizes when the value is changed and automatically creates the layer with the new display values (Figure 5.8). It is possible to change these display values after the user has navigated between images. Figure 5.8: NDVI with values in the range [0,1] Figure 5.9: NDVI with values in the range [0.3,1] 5.4 Time series The VI time series is obtained by clicking inside any polygon, therefore, the values are only for the selected polygon. The time series is shown in a graph where the average and standard deviation of the IV values are calculated. each point of the graph represents an image found according to the user’s configuration (Figure 5.10 y (Figure 5.11)).

VICAL has three main files that can be imported into a GEE Script, these are: // Image collections var imp = require(&#39;users/InifapCenidRaspa/VICAL:Exportaciones&#39;); // Vegetation indices var imp2= require(&#39;users/InifapCenidRaspa/VICAL:VegetationIndex&#39;); // visualization styles var St= require(&#39;users/InifapCenidRaspa/VICAL:Style&#39;); 6.1 Image collection Before importing the image collections, some variables must be declared that are useful for filtering this collection: i) a point or polygon; ii) date range, and iii) cloud threshold value in images. These declarations are shown in the following code: var fecha = [&#39;2021-01-01&#39;, &#39;2022-03-18&#39;]; //Start and end date //polygon or point var table = ee.FeatureCollection(&quot;projects/calcium-verbena-328905/assets/Bate&quot;); var p_nubes= 30;//percentage of clouds 6.1.1 Landsat If you want to use cloud-free atmospherically corrected LandSat images (4, 5, 7, 8 and 9), you can use the following code. A function is created to join the image collections. To do this, use the imp file. function ColeccionImagenSR(fecha, recorte, umbral) { // image collections are imported using the &quot;imp&quot; file var L9sr = imp.ColeccionLandsatSR(fecha, &#39;LC09&#39;, recorte, umbral); var L8sr = imp.ColeccionLandsatSR(fecha, &#39;LC08&#39;, recorte, umbral); var L7sr = imp.ColeccionLandsatSR(fecha, &#39;LE07&#39;, recorte, umbral); var L5sr = imp.ColeccionLandsatSR(fecha, &#39;LT05&#39;, recorte, umbral); var L4sr = imp.ColeccionLandsatSR(fecha, &#39;LT04&#39;, recorte, umbral); //ETM and ETM+ data are spectral fit to OLI and OLI-2 var L7a = L7sr.map(imp.TMaOLI); var L5a = L5sr.map(imp.TMaOLI); var L4a = L4sr.map(imp.TMaOLI); // Join collections var serieT =L9sr.merge(L8sr).merge(L7a).merge(L5a).merge(L4a).sort(&#39;system:time_start&#39;); return serieT; } //The collection is imported using the previous function var l8Sergio=ColeccionImagenSR(fecha, table, p_nubes); //we can print the images using the print() function to see if the //filtering of the image collection has been carried out (Figure 6.1) print (l8Sergio); With these image collections, time series of different vegetation indices can be calculated.
